# Noise, Clock and S&H

This module is a sort of 3-in-1 module, containing 4 types of noise, a clock generator based on a 555 IC and a sample-and-hold section. Itâ€™s based on / inspired by the Noise & S&H module by Niklas Ronnberg. It has a slew function, which is really nice, use it quit a lot.

The noise colors are White, Blue, Pink & Red. They are created by filtering the white noise. There are 2 trimmer pots on the back, one to set the overal noise volume and one to set the pulse length of the clock output.
